<h2>Motion control of a robot based on EEG signals</h2>
<div class="project">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I developed an algorithm in Matlab that uses an online database from BCI
        Competition III (Data set IVa - motor imagery, small training sets).
        The developed algorithm is labeled mainly in three stages: filtering,
        feature extraction and classification.</p>
    <h3>Results</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>LV (Log variance)</h3></li>
        <br>
        <p class="results-description">From the 118 channels we extracted the signal from channel C3,
            then filtered it with the help of the butterworth filter of order 5 bandpass,
            between 8-30 Hz. The 8-30Hz interval includes the μ band and the β band.
            I divided the filtered signal into signal segments corresponding to class
            1 of movements, the right hand, and class 2 of movements, the right leg.
            From each segment separately, I extracted the μ band with the help of a
            butterworth filter of order 5 band-pass, 8 -12Hz. Likewise, also with the
            help of a butterworth filter of the 5th order, this time between 15-30 Hz,
            we also obtained the β band from each segment. Then we extracted the LV
            from both the μ band of each segment and the α band of each segment.
            Finally we obtained 2 sets of features, one for the μ band and one for
            the β band, which we used for classification.</p>

        <p>In the figure below I represented the signal from the unprocessed C3
            channel and then the signal from the C3 channel to which I applied the
            fifth order Butterworth filter between 8-30 Hz, thus including the alpha
            and beta bands.</p>

        <p>In the figure below I have represented the signal extracted from the
            C3 channel, filtered after preprocessing, divided into signal segments
            corresponding to class 1 and class 2 movements, respectively.</p>

        <li><h3>Root mean square(RMS)</h3></li>
        <br>
        <p class="results-description">For the RMS calculation, the signal extracted from the C3 channel was
            filtered with the butterworth filter of the 5th order bandpass between
            0.5-30 Hz so that after the wavelet decomposition the µ, β, θ bands are
            isolated. The filtered signal was divided into segments for class 1,
            the right hand, and for class 2, the right leg. RMS was calculated for
            3 levels of wavelet decomposition applied to each segment. We used the
            Daubechies wavelet family, this being considered by specialists to be
            the best method that can be used within of EEG signal processing for a
            BCI system. In this paper, we decomposed each segment into 3 levels,
            thus obtaining 3 sets of features that were later classified.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We represented the three components resulting from the decomposition
            that isolate three of the most important frequency bands specific
            to EEG signals:</p>
